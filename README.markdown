# FriendFinder

FriendFinder is a full-stack website that asks the user to take a 10 question survey and respond with a numeric value from 1 - 5 for each question. The user's responses are stored in an array, and compared to each other individual in the database. The user is then shown a modal containing the name and picture of the person with the most similar survey responses - their new best friend.

FriendFinder uses the node package Express to handle the site's routing, and jQuery to handle the form input information and the POST request from the front-end.
